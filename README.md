## Personal note

next time that you wish to add a plugin, go to folder `bundle` and inside of
that folder run:

    git submodule add git://github.com/user/pluginToAdd.git

after that edit the file `vim-for-rails.vim` file and add the following at the
end of the `Bundle` section:

    Bundle 'user/pluginToAdd'

After that just commit your changes.
